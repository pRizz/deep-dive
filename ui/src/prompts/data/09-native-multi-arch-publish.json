  "title": "Publish Multi-Arch Images with Native Platform Builds",
  "teaser": "Eliminate emulation bottlenecks by splitting platform builds onto native runners and merging manifests by digest.",
  "category": "build-speed",
  "tags": ["github actions", "buildx", "multi-arch", "runner matrix", "qemu reduction"],
  "useWhen": "A single multi-platform build is slow because one or more architectures are built under emulation instead of native runners.",
  "expectedImpact": "Lower publish wall-clock time through parallel native platform builds, reduced cache export overhead, and preserved attestations.",
  "prompt": {
    "role": "You are a CI/CD and container release engineer optimizing Docker Buildx publish workflows for native multi-arch performance and supply-chain metadata correctness.",
    "objective": "Refactor a Docker publish workflow from one emulated multi-platform job into parallel per-platform jobs with native runner routing plus a digest-based manifest merge.",
    "requiredInputs": [
      "Current GitHub Actions publish workflow YAML and any caller workflow(s)",
      "Target platform list (for example linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x)",
      "Available runner types per platform (GitHub-hosted, self-hosted labels, and any constraints)",
      "Target image names and registries (for example Docker Hub and/or GHCR)",
      "Current tag/version strategy and required workflow outputs",
      "Current cache settings, baseline timings, and any security/scout requirements"
    ],
    "tasks": [
      "Document the current bottleneck and identify where emulated platforms dominate build time",
      "Design a DAG with a build-test gate, a matrix of per-platform build jobs, and a merge-and-publish job",
      "Implement a platform matrix with an explicit platform-to-runner mapping so each target platform routes to a native runner when available",
      "Use push-by-digest in each platform job, upload digests as artifacts, and merge all digests into final multi-arch manifests per registry",
      "Split cache scopes per platform for registry and GHA caches, and tune cache export mode (for example mode=min) to remove avoidable export overhead",
      "Preserve SBOM/provenance generation on each platform build and include verification steps for manifests, attestations, scout, and overall wall-clock improvement",
      "Define fallback behavior for platforms without native runners (for example keep emulation for only those platforms and document the expected tradeoff)"
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Do not use emulation for platforms that have native runner capacity available",
      "Keep the build-test gate as a prerequisite for publish jobs",
      "Preserve existing release tags and required workflow-call outputs unless explicitly instructed otherwise",
      "Keep security/scout checks non-blocking or blocking exactly as defined by current policy and call out any behavior changes",
      "Call out platform-specific limitations (runner availability, unsupported tooling, or architecture-specific build caveats)"
    ],
